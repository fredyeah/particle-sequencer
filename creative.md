# Product and Market Background

This is a creative brief concerning the further development of the Particle Sequencer.
The Particle Sequencer is a creative tool that abstracts and extracts control signals based off an array of physics engines and emulations.
The tool currently has an astral body orbit engine, an elastic collision engine, and a rudimentary gravity simulator.
Although currently the tool is in it's MVP stage, the ultimate goal is to make it publicly available and extend the project scope by offering a hardware version of the tool.

# Competition

Currently there is not much competition in the field of real time physics engine based music software and hardware.
There are a few instances of tools that do similar things, for instance single particle simulation in eurorack format, and a creative tool based off realtime planet positions.
Few other tools have been found, however, that allow a user to have full control over a small scale, real-time, physics engine.
Most of the possible competition, even those not directly related to this concept but more aesthetically similar, will likely be on [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

> [Quantum Chromodynamic Trigger Sequencer](https://library.vcvrack.com/Geodesics-Vultiverse/Hexaquark) is aesthetically similar  
> [Quadrivium](https://www.giorgiosancristoforo.net/softwares/) is conceptually similar, but not part of VCV Rack

# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to allow users of the tool to generate a broader range of control parameters and to promote more creative thinking.
The tool proves itself very useful for generating complex rythms and wave forms as well as providing a form of visual feedback for music creation.

# Target Audience

The target audience for this project is users who are looking for alternative methods of sudo-random control signal generation and generative audio.
The Particle Sequencer is intended to allow any user to explore possible bridges and bonds between interactions between physical objects and interactions between creative ideas.

# Tone of Voice

This project is intended to be perceived as a tool for experimental and artistic expression.

# Media

The media aspect of this project, or otherwise distribution platform, will be software, be it on an application or embedded level.
A form of high resolution visual feedback is of high importance to the concept and implementation.

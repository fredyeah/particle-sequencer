# Product and Market Background

This is a creative brief concerning the further development of the Particle Sequencer.
The Particle Sequencer is a creative tool that abstracts and extracts control signals based off an array of physics engines and emulations.
The tool currently has an astral body orbit engine, an elastic collision engine, and a rudimentary gravity simulator.
Although currently the tool is in it's MVP stage, the ultimate goal is to make it publicly available and extend the project scope by offering a hardware version of the tool.

# Competition

Currently there is not much competition in the field of real time physics engine based music software and hardware.
There are a few instances of tools that do similar things, for instance single particle simulation in eurorack format, and a creative tool based off realtime planet positions.
No other tools have been found, however, that allow a user to have full control over a small scale, real-time, physics engine.

# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to allow users of the tool to generate a broader range of control parameters and to promote more creative thinking.
The tool proves itself very useful for generating complex rythms and wave forms as well as providing a form of visual feedback for music creation.

# Target Audience

The target audience for this project is users who are looking for alternative methods of sudo-random control signal generation and generative audio.
The Particle Sequencer is intended to allow any user to explore possible bridges and bonds between interactions between physical objects and interactions between creative ideas.
